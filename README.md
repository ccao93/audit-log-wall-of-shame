# audit-log-wall-of-shame

A list of vendors that don't prioritize high-quality, widely-available audit logs for security and operations teams.

Vendor data for the table lives in [`data/vendors`](data/vendors/)

Current grading is set to "N" until a framework for grading is implemented.

The team is working on a Unified Log Standard with other security engineers to best grade vendors on log quality. The goal is to demonstrate common pitfalls and how to avoid these so log quality is improved. 

Great detection requires great logs!
